# Airline-Reservation-System
This project is a simple Airline Reservation System implemented in C++. It was developed as part of our freshman year structured programming course at our university. The application allows users to interact with the system to book flights, view available flights, and manage flight information. There are two main roles in the system: users and administrators. Users can search for flights, make reservations, and view their bookings, while administrators can manage flight details and bookings.
## Features
### User Functionality
    Search Flights: Users can search for available flights based on their preferred departure and destination locations, along with the desired travel date and time.

    View Flights: Users can view a list of available flights that match their search criteria, including flight details such as flight number, departure and arrival times, and available seats.

    Make Reservation: Users can choose a specific flight and make a reservation by providing their personal information and selecting the number of seats they want to book.

    View Bookings: Users can view their current bookings, including flight details and reservation status.
### Admin Functionality
    Add Flights: Administrators can add new flights to the system by providing flight details such as flight number, departure and arrival locations, departure and arrival times, and available seats.

    Update Flights: Administrators can update the details of existing flights, such as modifying departure/arrival times or the number of available seats.

    Manage Bookings: Administrators have access to the list of bookings made by users. They can view booking details, modify reservation information, or cancel bookings if needed.
